 * @brief
 * Typeless base class for the typed Topic.
 *
 * Topics are created type specific (fi Topic<Foo::Bar> topic). However, there
 * are a few places in the API (and possibly application) where the type can not be known
 * while still some Topic has to be passed around, stored or even typeless functionality
 * called.<br>
 * The main examples in the API that needs typeless Topic is: DomainParticipantListener.
