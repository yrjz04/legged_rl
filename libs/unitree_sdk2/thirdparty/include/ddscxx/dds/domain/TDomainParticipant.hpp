/**
 * @brief
 * A DomainParticipant represents the local membership of the application in a
 * Domain.
 *
 * The DomainParticipant represents the participation of the application on
 * a communication plane that isolates applications running on the same
 * set of physical computers from each other. A domain establishes a virtual
 * network linking all applications that share the same domainId and isolating
 * them from applications running on different domains. In this way, several
 * independent distributed applications can coexist in the same physical
 * network without interfering, or even being aware of each other.
